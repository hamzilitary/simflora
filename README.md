# Simflora
Epicodus Team Week Project 1 - Object Oriented Javascript

#### By Jared Clemmensen, Russell Hofvendahl, Hamza Naeem, and Cameron Anderson

## Description

This website was created for the Intro to Programming group project in the Epicodus development bootcamp. The purpose for this project is to apply learnings from the first 4 weeks of curriculum learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Simflora adapts the logic behind Aristid Lindenmayer's l-systems to simulate plan growth given a set of rules determining patterns of branching. Three.js was used to create a simple environment that follows the flow of days and seasons as well as a procedurally generated animation of a growing maple trea.

## Specifications
* User loads page with animated environment, is given navigation/use instructions and is able to initiate growth animation
  * Example Input: User hit initiate or reset button
  * Example Output: Program begins modeling tree growth
* User changes flow of time via interactive element
  * Example Input: Slide range from 0 (paused) to 12x flow of time
  * Example Output: Program increases passing of days/seasons as well as tree growth rate

## Setup/Installation Requirements
